Telegram desktop on Windows (10 or 11) will display small Khmer text, hard to read.

The solution mostly is go to change the font face in Regedit. So involve as Advance user where it's not neccessary to do so as we have simple one here.

Just install this font: `!KhmerOSSiemreap.ttf`

In next restart, the Telegram will display the text correctly.
